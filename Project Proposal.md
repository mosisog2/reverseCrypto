## Overview
Our project is on reverse software engineering and how we can apply this concept to certain cryptosystems. *(add more here)*

## ( Retriever: A view-based approach to reverse engineering software architecture models)

The paper delves into reverse engineering techniques for understanding software architecture, specifically focusing on Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and Unified Modeling Language (UML). The authors introduce key terms that lay the foundation for their proposed algorithm, such as Metamodel, Model, ViewType, and others. These terms are crucial for the paper's framework and methodology.

The paper proposes a view-based approach to reverse-engineering software models, emphasizing the need for models that capture the software's structure and behavior. It introduces an architecture-driven process that allows extracting and refining software models using several rules: ExtractionRule, Refinement Rule, and Finalization Rule. These rules are used in conjunction with various elements such as TraceLink, Artifact, and ModelElement to ensure that the reverse-engineered models are consistent and reflect the software's true structure.

To assess the effectiveness of their approach, the authors define a metric for evaluating reverse-engineering models. This metric is applied to various case studies, illustrating how their method improves the accuracy and completeness of the generated models compared to traditional reverse-engineering techniques.

There are several pictures to be inserted, I would recommend looking into the paper as it goes into details explaining the terminology and the algorithm.

In conclusion, the approach offers a structured methodology for reverse engineering that could potentially be applied to enhance software maintenance, improve system understanding, and facilitate architectural analysis in complex systems.
